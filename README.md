# My Personal Portfolio 2024

Welcome to Personal Portfolio! ðŸ˜Ž
This is a CSS-enhanced Personal Portfolio project showcasing my abilities in CSS and HTML5.


How to use: Go to https://github.com/spikenardJ/personal_portfolio_enhancement_project.git  and download the raw file in the upper right corner of the code. After downloading, go to your V.S. Code and upload it there. Once you have it on V.S. Code you can enjoy my updated personal portfolio as well as edit if you like and then show your suggestions as comments on here!
